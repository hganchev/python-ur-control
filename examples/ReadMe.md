# Pick and place example

The `pick_and_place.py` script is responsible for picking up objects from a source location and placing them at a target location. Here is a high-level overview of its logic:

1. Initialize the robot arm and connect to the control system.
2. Define the source and target positions for picking and placing objects.
3. Move the robot arm to the source position.
4. Use the gripper to pick up the object.
5. Move the robot arm to the target position.
6. Use the gripper to release the object.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each object to be picked and placed.
8. Disconnect from the control system and shut down the robot arm.

The `pick_and_place.py` script can be customized to fit specific picking and placing requirements by modifying the positions and adding any necessary logic for object detection or error handling.


## Palletization Example

The code you provided appears to be a function named Palletization() that performs a series of actions related to palletization. Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. Create a pallet: The code defines three corners of a pallet using coordinate values. Then, it calls a function ur_control.create_pallet() to create a pallet with 10 rows and 10 columns, using the specified corner coordinates.

2. Set the tool center point (TCP): The code calls ur_control.set_tcp() function to set the tool center point to [0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0]. The TCP is the reference point on the robot's end effector where the tool or gripper is attached.

3. Set the payload: The code calls ur_control.set_payload() function to set the payload of the robot. In this case, the payload is set to 0 kg, with the center of gravity at [0, 0, 0] and the inertia matrix [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

4. Go to pallet position: The code enters a loop that iterates 99 times. In each iteration, it performs the following actions:
