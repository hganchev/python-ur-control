# Pick and place example

The `pick_and_place.py` script is responsible for picking up objects from a source location and placing them at a target location. Here is a high-level overview of its logic:

1. Initialize the robot arm and connect to the control system.
2. Define the source and target positions for picking and placing objects.
3. Move the robot arm to the source position.
4. Use the gripper to pick up the object.
5. Move the robot arm to the target position.
6. Use the gripper to release the object.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each object to be picked and placed.
8. Disconnect from the control system and shut down the robot arm.

The `pick_and_place.py` script can be customized to fit specific picking and placing requirements by modifying the positions and adding any necessary logic for object detection or error handling.
